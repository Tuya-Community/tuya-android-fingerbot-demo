    <string name="device_config_ble_hint">Single-point Bluetooth devices are devices that have a one-to-one connection with a cell phone terminal via Bluetooth, such as Bluetooth bracelets,
        Bluetooth headsets, Bluetooth speakers, etc.
        Each device can be connected to a cell phone at the same time,
        and the number of simultaneous Bluetooth connections per cell phone terminal is currently
        limited to 6 to 7.\n\nTap Search to pair BLE device.</string>
